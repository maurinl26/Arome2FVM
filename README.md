# Arome2FVM
Conversion tool from AROME state variables to FVM ones. Among transformations, mass based coordinate is translated to height based terrain following coordinate, vertical wind is computed from vertical divergence, and exner pressure and potential temperature are computed. Since AROME vertical levels 
## Z coordinate
## Vertical divergence to vertical velocity
